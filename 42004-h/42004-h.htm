<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>REMARKABLE IMPRINTS.</h3>

  <p>More than one pen has considered titles, dedications, and imprints
  worth a Note, and as there are still gleanings in their track, I take the
  liberty of sending you a few of the latter; some from my common-place
  book, others from the fountainheads on my own shelves, but all drawn at
  random, without much regard to classification or chronological
  arrangement.</p>

  <p>The horrors of the Star Chamber and the Ecclesiastical Courts produced
  many extraordinary imprints, particularly to those seditious books of the
  Puritans, better known as the <i>Marprelate Family</i>; works which were
  printed by ambulatory presses, and circulated by unseen hands, now under
  the walls of Archiepiscopal Lambeth, and <i>presto</i>! (when the spy
  would lay his hands upon them) sprite-like, Martin re-appeared in the
  provinces! This game at hide and seek between the brave old
  Nonconformists and the Church, went on for years without detection: but
  the readers of "N. &amp; Q." do not require from me the history of the
  Marprelate Faction, so well told already in the <i>Miscellanies of
  Literature</i> and elsewhere; the animus of these towards the hierarchy
  will be sufficiently exhibited for my purpose in a few of their imprints.
  <i>An Almond for a Parrot</i>, for example, purports to be&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Imprynted at a place not farre from a place; by the Assignes of
  Signior Some-body, and are to be soulde at his shoppe in Trouble-Knave
  Street."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, <i>Oh read ouer D. John Bridges, for it is a worthy work</i>,
  is</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Printed ouer sea, in Europe, within two forlongs of a Bouncing
  Priest, at the Cost and Charges of Martin Marprelate, Gent, 1589."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>The Return of the renowned Cavaliero Pasquill</i> has the following
  extraordinary imprint:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If my breath be so hote that I burne my mouthe, I suppose I was
  printed by Pepper Allie, 1589."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The original "Marprelate" was John Penri, who at last fell into the
  hands of his enemies, and was executed under circumstances of great
  barbarity in Elizabeth's reign. "Martin Junior," however, sprung up, and
  <i>The Counter-Cuffe</i> to him is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Printed between the Skye and the Grounde, wythin a Myle of an Oake,
  and not many Fields off from the unpriuileged Presse of the Ass-ignes of
  Martin Junior, 1589."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The virulency of this theological warfare died away in James's reign,
  but only to be renewed with equal rancour in that of Charles, when
  Marprelatism was again called into activity by the high-church freaks of
  Archbishop Laud. <i>Vox Borealis, or a Northerne Discoverie by way of
  Dialogue between Jamie and Willie</i>, is an example of these later
  attacks upon the overbearing of the mitre, and affords the
  imprint&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Amidst the Babylonians. Printed by Margery Marprelate, in Thwack-Coat
  Lane, at the Signe of the Crab-Tree Cudgell, without any privilege of the
  Cater-Caps, 1641."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Others of this stamp will occur to your readers: this time the
  Puritans had the best of the struggle, and ceased not to push their
  advantage until they brought their enemy to the block.</p>

  <p>When the liberty of the press was imperfectly understood, the
  political satirist had to tread warily; consequently we find that class
  of writers protecting themselves by jocular or patriotic imprints. A
  satirical pamphlet upon the late <i>Sicke Commons</i> is "Printed in the
  Happie Year 1641." <i>A Letter from Nobody in the City to Nobody in the
  Country</i> is "Printed by Somebody, 1679." <i>Somebody's Answer</i> is
  "Printed for Anybody." These were likely of such a tendency as would have
  rendered both author and printer amenable to <i>somebody</i>, say Judge
  Jeffries. During the administration of Sir Robert Walpole, there were
  many skirmishing satirists supported by both ministry and people, such as
  James Miller, whose pamphlet, <i>contra, Are these things so?</i> is
  "Printed for the perusal of all Lovers of their Country, 1740." This was
  answered by the ministers' champion, James Dance, <i>alias</i> Love, in
  <i>Yes, they are!</i> alike addressed to the "Lovers of their Country."
  <i>What of That?</i> was the next of the series, being Miller's reply,
  who intimated this time that it was "Printed, and to be had of all True
  Hearts and Sound Bottoms."</p>

  <p>When there was a movement for an augmentation of the poor stipends of
  the Scots Clergy in 1750, there came out a pamphlet under the title of
  <i>The Presbyterian Clergy seasonably detected</i>, 1751, which exceeds
  in scurrility, if possible, the famous or infamous, <i>Scotch
  Presbyterian Eloquence Displayed</i>; both author and printer, however,
  had so much sense as to remain in the background, and the <i>thing</i>
  purported to be "Printed for Mess John in Fleet Street." Under the title
  of <i>The Comical History of the Marriage betwixt Heptarchus and
  Fergusia</i>, 1706<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, the Scots figured the union of the
  Lord Heptarchus, or England, with the independent, but coerced, damsel
  Fergusia, or Scotland; the discontented church of the latter <!-- Page
  144 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>finding
  that the former broke faith with her, could not help giving way to
  occasional murmurings, and these found vent in (among others) a poetical
  Presbyterian tract, entitled <i>Melancholy Sonnets, or Fergusia's
  Complaint upon Heptarchus</i>, in which the author reduced to rhyme the
  aforesaid <i>Comical History</i>, adding thereto all the evils this
  ill-starred union had entailed upon the land after thirty-five years'
  experience. This curious production was "Printed at Elguze? for
  Pedaneous, and sold by Circumferaneous, below the Zenith, 1741."<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Charles II.,
  when crowned at Scone, took the solemn league and covenant; but not
  finding it convenient to carry out that part of his coronation oath, left
  the Presbyterians at the Restoration in the lands of their enemies. To
  mark their sense of this breach of faith, there was published a little
  book<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  describing the inauguration of the <i>young profligate</i>, which
  expressively purports to be "Printed at Edinburgh in the Year of
  Covenant-breaking." The Scots folk had such a horror of anything of a
  deistical tendency, that John Goldie had to publish his <i>Essays, or an
  Attempt to distinguish true from false Religion</i> (popularly called
  "Goldie's Bible"), at Glasgow, "Printed for the Author, and sold by him
  at Kilmarnock, 1779;" neither printer nor bookseller would, apparently,
  be identified with the <i>unclean thing</i>. Both churchmen and
  dissenters convey their exultations, or denouncements, upon political
  changes, through the medium of imprints; and your correspondents who have
  been discussing that matter, will see in some of these that the "Good Old
  Cause" may be "all round the compass," as Captain Cuttle would say,
  depending wholly upon the party spectacles through which you view it.
  <i>Legal Fundamental Liberty</i>, in an epistle from Selburne to Lenthal,
  is "Reprinted in the Year of Hypocritical and Abominable Dissimulation,
  1649;" on the other hand, <i>The Little Bible</i> of that militant
  soldier Captain Butler is "Printed in the First Year of England's
  Liberty, 1649." <i>The Last Will and Testament of Sir John Presbyter</i>
  is "Printed in the Year of Jubilee, 1647." <i>A New Meeting of Ghosts at
  Tyburn</i>, in which Oliver, Bradshaw, and Peters figure, exhibits its
  royal tendency, being "Printed in the Year of the Rebellious Phanatick's
  Downfall, 1660." "Printed at N., with Licence," is the cautious imprint
  of a republication of <i>Doleman's Conference</i> in 1681. <i>A proper
  Project to Startle Fools</i> is "Printed in a Land where Self's cry'd up,
  and Zeal's cry'd down, 1699." <i>The Impartial Accountant, wherein it is
  demonstratively made known how to pay the National Debt, and that without
  a New Tax, or any Inconveniency to the People</i>, is "Printed for a
  Proper Person," and, I may add, can be had of a <i>certain person</i>, if
  Mr. Gladstone will come down with an adequate consideration for the
  secret! These accountants are all mysterious,&mdash;you would think they
  were plotting to empty the treasury rather than to fill it; another says
  his <i>Essay Upon National Credit</i> is "Printed by A. R. in Bond's
  Stables!" Thomas Scott, the English minister at Utrecht, published, among
  other oddities, <i>Vox C&oelig;lis; or Newes from Heaven, being Imaginary
  Conversations there between Henry VIII.(!), Edward VI, Prince Henrie, and
  others</i>, "Printed in Elysium, 1624." Edward Raban, an Englishman, who
  set up a press in the far north, published an edition of Lady Culros'
  <i>Godlie Dreame</i>, and finding that no title commanded such respect
  among the canny Scots as that of <i>Laird</i>, announced the book to be
  "Imprinted at Aberdene, by E. R., Laird of Letters, 1644." <i>The
  Instructive Library</i>, containing a list of apocryphal books, and a
  satire upon some theological authors of that day, is "Printed for the Man
  in the Moon, 1710." <i>The Oxford Sermon Versified</i>, by Jacob Gingle,
  Esq., is "Printed by Tim. Atkins at Dr. Sacheverell's Head, near St.
  Paul's, 1729." "Printed, and to be had at the Pamphlett Shops of London
  and Westminster," was a common way of circulating productions of
  questionable morals or loyalty. The Chapmen, or Flying-Stationers, had
  many curious dodges of this kind to give a relish to their literary
  wares: <i>The Secret History of Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex</i>
  derived additional interest in the eyes of their country customers by its
  being "Printed at Cologne for Will-with-the-Wisp, at the Sign of the Moon
  in the Ecliptic, 1767." The Poems of that hard-headed Jacobite, Alexander
  Robertson of Struan, are "Printed at Edinburgh for Charles Alexander, and
  sold at his house in Geddes Close, where Subscribers may call for their
  Copies, circa 1750."<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <i>The New Dialogues of the Dead</i>
  are "Printed for D. Y., at the foot of Parnassus Hill, 1684." Professor
  Tenant's poem of <i>Papistry Stormed</i> imitates the old typographers,
  it being "Imprentit at Edinbrogh be Oliver and Boyd, anno 1827." A rare
  old book is Goddard's <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span><i>Mastiffe Whelpe</i>, "Imprinted amongst
  the Antipodes, and are to be sould where they are to be bought." Another,
  by the same author, is a <i>Satirical Dialogue</i>, "Imprinted in the Low
  Countreyes for all such Gentlemen as are not altogether idle, nor yet
  well occupyed." These were both, I believe, libels upon the fair sex.
  John Stewart, otherwise <i>Walking Stewart</i>, was in the habit of
  dating his extraordinary publications "In the year of Man's Retrospective
  Knowledge, by Astronomical Calculation, 5000;" "In the 7000 year of
  Astronomical History in the Chinese Tables;" and "In the Fifth Year of
  Intellectual Existence." "Mulberry Hill, Printed at Crazy Castle," is an
  imprint of J. H. Stevenson. <i>The Button Makers' Jests</i>, by Geo.
  King. of St. James', is "Printed for Henry Frederick, near St. James'
  Square;" a coarse squib upon royalty. One Fisher entitled his play
  <i>Thou shall not Steal; the School of Ingratitude</i>. Thinking the
  managers of Drury Lane had communicated his performance, under the latter
  name, to Reynolds the dramatist, and then rejected it, he published it
  thus: "Printed for the curious and literary&mdash;shall we say?
  Coincidence! refused by the Managers, and made use of in the Farce of
  'Good Living,'" published by Reynolds in 1797. <i>Harlequin Premier, as
  it is daily acted</i>, is a hit at the ministry of the period, "Printed
  at Brentafordia, Capital of Barataria, and sold by all the Booksellers in
  the Province, 1769." "Printed Merrily, and may be read Unhappily, betwixt
  Hawke and Buzzard, 1641," is the <i>satisfactory</i> imprint of <i>The
  Downefall of temporising Poets, unlicensed Printers, upstart Booksellers,
  tooting Mercuries, and bawling Hawkers</i>. Books have sometimes been
  published for behoof of particular individuals; old Daniel Rodgers, in
  his <i>Matrimonial Honour</i>, announces "A Part of the Impression to be
  vended for the use and benefit of Ed. Minsheu, Gent., 1650." How full of
  interest is the following, "Printed at Sheffield by James Montgomery, in
  the Hart's Head, 1795!" A poor man, by name J. R. Adam, meeting with
  reverses, enlisted, and after serving abroad for a period, returned but
  to exchange the barrack-room for the Glasgow Lunatic Asylum. Possessing a
  poetical vein, he indulged it here in soothing his own and his
  companions' misery, by circulating his verses on detached scraps, printed
  by himself. These on his enlargement he collected together, and gave to
  the world in 1845, under the title of the <i>Gartnavel Minstrel</i>, a
  neat little square volume of 104 pages, exceedingly well executed, and
  bearing the imprint "Glasgow, composed, printed, and published by J. R.
  Adam;" under any circumstances a most creditable specimen, but under
  those I have described "a <i>rara avis</i> in literature and art."</p>

  <p>The list might be spun out, but I fear I have exceeded limits already
  with my dry subject.</p>

  <p>G. Chalmers ascribed this to one "Balantyne." In Lockhart's
  <i>Memoirs</i>, Lond. 1714, Mr. John Balantyne, the minister of Lanark,

  Alexander Robertson, in Morison's Close, where subscribers may call for
  their copies (1785?).</p>

<h3>LEGENDS OF THE CO. CLARE.</h3>

  <p>In the west of Clare, for many miles the country seems to consist of
  nothing but fields of grey limestone flags, which gives it an appearance
  of the greatest desolation: Cromwell is reported to have said of it,
  "that there was neither wood in it to hang a man, nor water to drown him,
  nor earth to bury him!" The soil is not, however, by any means as barren
  as it looks; and the following legend is related of the way in which an
  ancestor of one of the most extensive landed proprietors in the county
  obtained his estates.</p>

  <p>'Twas on a dismal evening in the depth of winter, that one of
  Cromwell's officers was passing through this part of the country; his
  courage and gallantry in the "good cause" had obtained for him a large
  grant of land in Clare, and he was now on his journey to it. Picturing to
  himself a land flowing with milk and honey, his disappointment may
  therefore be imagined when, at the close of a weary day's journey, he
  found himself bewildered amid such a scene of desolation. From the
  inquiries he had made at the last inhabited place he had passed, he was
  led to conclude that he could not be far distant from the "land of
  promise," where he might turn his sword into a pruning-hook, and rest
  from all his toils and dangers. Could this be the place of which his
  imagination had formed so fair a vision? Hours had elapsed since he had
  seen a human being; and, as the solitude added to the dismal appearance
  of the road, bitterly did the veteran curse the folly that had enticed
  him into the land of bogs and "Papistrie." Troublous therefore as the
  times were, the tramp of an approaching steed sent a thrill of pleasure
  through the heart of the Puritan. The rider soon joined him, and as he
  seemed peaceably disposed, they entered into conversation; and the
  stranger soon became acquainted with the old soldier's errand, and the
  disappointment he had experienced. Artfully taking advantage of the
  occasion, the stranger, who professed an acquaintance with the country,
  used every means to aggravate the disgust of his fellow-traveller, till
  the heart of the Cromwellian, already half overcome by fatigue and
  hunger, sank within him; and at last he agreed that the land should be
  transferred to the stranger for a butt of Claret and the horse on which
  he rode. As soon as this important matter was settled, the stranger
  conducted his new friend to a house of entertainment in a neighbouring
  hamlet, whose ruins are still called the Claret House of K&mdash;&mdash;.
  A plentiful, though coarse, entertainment soon smoked on the board; and
  as the eye of the Puritan wandered over the "creature comforts," his
  heart rose, and he forgot his disappointment and his fatigue. It is even
  said that he dispensed with nearly ten of the twenty minutes which he
  usually bestowed on the benediction; <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span>but be this as it may,
  ere he retired to his couch&mdash;"vino ciboque gravatus"&mdash;the
  articles were signed, and the courteous stranger became possessed of one
  of the finest estates in the county!</p>

<h3>CANTING ARMS.</h3>

  <p>In the introduction to a work entitled <i>A Collection of Coats of
  Arms borne by the Nobility and Gentry of the County of Gloucester</i>,
  London, J. Good, 159. New Bond Street, 1792, and which I believe was
  written by Sir George Nayler, it is asserted that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Armes parlantes</i>, or canting arms, were not common till the
  commencement of the seventeenth century, when they prevailed under the
  auspices of King James."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now doubtless they were <i>more</i> common in the seventeenth century,
  but I am of opinion that there are many instances of them
  <i>centuries</i> previous to the reign of King James; as, for example, in
  a roll of arms of the time of Edward II. (<span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  1308-14), published by Sir Harris Nicolas from a manuscript in the
  British Museum, there are the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sire Peres Corbet, d'or, à un <i>corbyn</i> de sable.</p>

  <p>Sire Johan le Fauconer, d'argent, à iii <i>faucouns</i> de goules.</p>

  <p>Sire Johan Heroun, d'azure, à iii <i>herouns</i> d'argent.</p>

  <p>Sire Richard de Cokfeld, d'azure, à une crois e iiii <i>coks</i>
  d'or.</p>

  <p>Sire Richard de Barlingham, de goules, à iii ours (<i>bears</i>)
  d'argent.</p>

  <p>Sire Johan de Swyneford, d'argent, à un cheveroun de sable, à iii
  testes de <i>cenglers</i> (<i>swines' heads</i>) d'or."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sire Ammon de Lucy bore three <i>luces</i>; Sire William Bernak a fers
  between three barnacles, &amp;c. There are many other examples in the
  same work, but as I think I have made my communication quite long enough,
  I forbear giving them.</p>

  <p><i>A Hint to Publishers.</i>&mdash;The present period is remarkable
  for its numerous reprints of our poets and standard writers. However
  excellent these may be, there is often a great drawback, viz. that one
  must purchase an author's entire works, and cannot get a favourite poem
  or treatise separately.</p>

  <p>What I would suggest is, that a separate title-page be prefixed to
  every poem or treatise in an <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page147"></a>{147}</span>author's works, and that they be sold
  collectively or separately at the purchaser's option. Thus few would
  encumber themselves with the entire works of Dryden, but many would
  gladly purchase some of his poems if they could be had separately.</p>

  <p>These remarks are still more applicable to encyclopædias. The
  <i>Encycl. Metropol.</i> was a step in the right direction; and
  henceforth we may hope to have each article sold separately in
  <i>octavo</i> volumes. Is there no chance, amid all these reprints, of
  our seeing Heywood, Crashaw, Southwell, Habington, Daniel, or Drummond of
  Hawthornden?</p>

  <p><i>Uhland, the German Poet.</i>&mdash;Mr. Mitchell, in his speech at
  New York, is said to have stated that Uhland, the German poet, had become
  an exile, and was now in Ohio. This is a mistake; for Uhland is now
  living in his native Würtemberg, and is reported in the papers to have
  quite recently declined a civic honour proposed to be conferred on him by
  the King of Prussia at the suggestion of Baron Humboldt.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>THE SHIPPEN FAMILY&mdash;JOHN WHITE.</h3>

  <p>The Historical Society of Pennsylvania having requested me to edit
  certain MSS., I should be very much indebted to any one for information,
  either through your columns, or addressed to me directly, concerning the
  following persons or their ancestry.</p>

  <p>Edward Shippen, son of William, born in Yorkshire, near Pontefract or
  Wakefield, as supposed, 1639; emigrated to Boston 1670, was a member of
  the Ancient and Honourable Artillery Company, afterwards turned Quaker,
  was publicly whipt for his faith (see Thomas Story's <i>Journal</i>,
  quoted in Southey's <i>Common-Place Book</i>), removed to Philadelphia,
  elected Speaker 1695, first mayor 1701, &amp;c., died 1712. His son's
  family Bible entries (now in possession of Colonel Jno. Hare Powel) say
  that his (the son's) relations in England were his "uncle William's
  children," viz. Robert Shippen, Doctor of Divinity; William Shippen,
  Doctor of Laws and a parliament man; Edward, a physician; John, a Spanish
  merchant.</p>

  <p>The uncle William thus mentioned is conjectured to have been the
  Rector of Stockport, and the "parliament man" to have been his son,
  "downright Shippen" (Lord Mahon's <i>Hist. Eng.</i>, three vols.)&mdash;a
  conjecture strengthened by another mem., "John, son of the Rector of St.
  Mary's parish, Stockport, was baptized July 5, <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1678.</p>

  <p>Edward Shippen's daughter, Margaret, married John Jekyll, collector of
  the port of Boston, said to have been a younger brother of Sir Joseph;
  and a descendant, daughter of Chief Justice Shippen, married General
  Benedict Arnold, then a distinguished officer in the American army.</p>

  <p>Mr. Shippen lived in great style (Watson's <i>Annals</i>, &amp;c.),
  and among his descendants were, and are, many persons of consequence and
  distinction.</p>

  <p>Besides information as to Mr. Shippen's ancestors, I should be glad to
  learn something of his kinsfolk, and of the Jekyll and Arnold branches.
  Sabine's (<i>Loyalists</i>) account of the latter is imperfect, and
  perhaps not very just.</p>

  <p>John White, Chief Justice Shippen, whilst a law student in London,
  writes, 1748-50, as though Mr. White was socially a man of dignified
  position. He was a man of large fortune; his sister married San. Swift,
  who emigrated to this state. His portrait, by Reynolds, represents a
  gentleman past middle age, whose costume and appearance are those of a
  person of refined and elegant education. His letters were destroyed by
  fire some years since. The China and silver ware, which belonged to him,
  have the following arms: "Gules, a border sable, charged with seven or
  eight estoiles gold; on a canton ermines a lion rampant sable. Crest, a
  bird, either a stork, a heron, or an ostrich." The copy inclosed is taken
  from the arms on the china; but our Heralds' College (<i>i.e.</i> an
  intelligent engraver, who gave me the foregoing description) says, that
  on the silver the crest is "a stork close."</p>

<h3>BOOKS ISSUED IN PARTS AND NOT COMPLETED.</h3>

  <p>From time to time various productions, many valuable, others the
  reverse, have issued from the press in parts or numbers; some have been
  completed, while others have only reached a few numbers. It would be
  desirable to ascertain what works have been finished, and what have not.
  I have therefore transmitted a note as to several that have fallen in my
  way, and should be happy for any information about them:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1. John Bull Magazine, 8vo., London, 1824. Of this I possess four
  numbers. A friend of mine has also the four numbers, and, like myself,
  attaches great value to them, from the ability of many of the articles.
  One article, entitled "Instructions to Missionaries," is equal to any
  thing from the pen of T. Hood. May it not have been written by him? <!--
  Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span></p>

  <p>2. Portraits of the Worthies of Westminster Hall, with their
  Autographs, being Fac-Similes of Original Sketches found in the Note-Book
  of a Briefless Barrister. London: Thomas and William Boone, 480. Strand.

  William Smith, F.R.S.A. 4to. Birmingham: W. Evans. London: J. T. Hinton,
  4. Warwick Square. 1829. Ten Numbers, to be completed in Twelve. On my
  copy there is written, "Never finished." Is this the case?</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Branks, or Gossips' Bridles.</i>&mdash;Walton Church contains one
  of those strange instruments with which our ancestors used to punish
  those dames who were too free with the use of their tongues. They were
  called hanks [branks], or gossips' bridles, and were intended to inclose
  the head, being fastened behind by a padlock, and having attached to it a
  small piece of iron which literally "held the tongue." Thus accoutred,
  the unhappy culprit was marched through the village till she gave
  unequivocal signs of repentance and humiliation. Can any one give some
  account of this curious instrument?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">George Hodges.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Oxford.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Fosbroke says that "the brank is a sugar-loaf cap made of iron
  hooping, with a cross at top, and a flat piece projecting inwards to lie
  upon the tongue. It was put upon the head of scolds, padlocked behind,
  and a string annexed, by which a man led them through the towns." (See
  also Brand's <i>Popular Antiquities</i>, vol. iii. p. 108., Bohn's
  edition.) Engravings of them will be found in Plot's <i>History of
  Staffordshire</i>, p. 389., and in Brands <i>History of Newcastle</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 192. In the <i>Historical Description of the Tower of
  London</i>, p. 54., edit. 1774, occurs the following libellous squib on
  the fair sex: "Among the curiosities of the Tower is a collar of torment,
  which, say your conductors, used formerly to be put about the women's
  neck that cuckolded their husbands, or scolded them when they came home
  late; but that custom is left off now-a-days, to prevent quarrelling for
  collars, there not being smiths enough to make them, as most married men
  are sure to want them at one time or another." Waldron, in his
  <i>Description of the Isle of Man</i>, p. 80., thus notices this
  instrument of punishment: "I know nothing in the Manx statutes or
  punishments in particular but this, which is, that if any person be
  convicted of uttering a scandalous report, and cannot make good the
  assertion, instead of being fined or imprisoned, they are sentenced to
  stand in the market-place, on a sort of scaffold erected for that
  purpose, with their tongue in a noose made of leather, which they call a
  <i>bridle</i>, and having been exposed to the view of the people for some
  time, on the taking off this machine, they are obliged to say three
  times, 'Tongue, thou hast lyed.'"]</p>

  <p><i>Not caring a Fig for anything.</i>&mdash;What is the origin of this
  expression?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. H. Chateau.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Nares informs us that the real origin of this expression may be found
  in Stevens and Pineda's Dictionaries under <i>Higa</i>; and, in fact, the
  same phrase and allusion pervaded all modern Europe: as, <i>Far le
  fiche</i>, Ital.; <i>Faire la figue</i>, Fr.; <i>Die Feigen weisen</i>,
  Germ., <i>De vÿghe setten</i>, Dutch. (See Du Cange, in <i>Ficha</i>.)
  Johnson says, "To <i>fig</i>, in Spanish, <i>higas dar</i>, is to insult
  by putting the thumb between the fore and middle finger. From this
  Spanish custom we yet say in contempt, <i>A fig for you</i>." To this
  explanation Mr. Douce has added the following note: "Dr. Johnson has
  properly explained this phrase; but it should be added, that it is of
  Italian origin. When the Milanese revolted against the Emperor Frederick
  Barbarossa, they placed the Empress his wife upon a mule with her head
  towards the tail, and ignominiously expelled her their city. Frederick
  afterwards besieged and took the place, and compelled every one of his
  prisoners, on pain of death, to take with his teeth a <i>fig</i> from the
  posteriors of a mule. The party was at the same time obliged to repeat to
  the executioner the words <i>Ecco la fica</i>. From this circumstance
  <i>far la fica</i> became a term of derision, and was adopted by other
  nations. The French say likewise, <i>faire la figue</i>."]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>B. C. Y.</i>&mdash;Can you give me any information respecting the
  famous B. C. Y. row, as it was called, which occurred about fifty years
  ago? A newspaper was started expressly to explain the meaning of the
  letters, which said it was "Beware of the Catholic Yoke;" but it was
  wrong.</p>

  <p class="author">H. Y.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[These "No-Popery" hieroglyphics first appeared in the reign of
  Charles II. during the debates on the Exclusion Bill, and were chalked
  over all parts of Whitehall and the Houses of Parliament. O B. C. Y. was
  then the inscription, which meant, "O Beware of Catholic York." On their
  re-appearance in 1809 the Y. was much taller than the B. C.; but the use
  and meaning at this time of these initials still remains a query.]</p>

  <p><i>Earl Nugent's Poems.</i>&mdash;I would be much obliged for any
  information relating to the poems written by Robert, afterwards Earl

<div class="note">
  <p>[This seems to be some ecclesiastical due payable on Hlaf-mass, or
  Loaf-mass, commonly called Lammas-Day (August 1st). See Somner and
  Junius. It was called Loaf or Bread-mass, because it was a day of
  oblation of grain, or of bread made of new wheat; and was also the
  holiday of St. Peter ad Vincula, when Peter-pence were paid. Du Cange
  likewise mentions the <i>Panis benedictus</i>, and that money was given
  by the recipients of it on the following occasion:&mdash;"Since the
  catechumens," says he, "before baptism could neither partake of the
  Divine Mysteries, nor consequently of the Eucharist, a loaf was
  consecrated and given to them by the priest, whereby they were prepared
  for receiving the body of Christ."]</p>

  that the exact time when it became parochial is not known; but it was

<h3>DEATH-WARNINGS IN ANCIENT FAMILIES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix. p. 55.)</p>

  <p>The remarks of <span class="sc">John o' the Ford</span> of Malta
  deserve to be followed up by all your correspondents who, at least, admit
  the possibility of "communications with the unseen world." In order to
  facilitate the acquisition of the requisite amount of facts, I beg to
  apprise <span class="sc">John o' the Ford</span>, and your other
  correspondents and readers generally, that a Society was founded about a
  year ago, and is now in existence, composed of members of the University
  of Cambridge; the objects of which will be best gleaned from the
  following extract from the Prospectus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The interest and importance of a serious and earnest inquiry into the
  nature of the phenomena which are vaguely called 'supernatural,' will
  scarcely be questioned. Many persons believe that all such apparently
  mysterious occurrences are due, either to purely natural causes, or to
  delusions of the mind or senses, or to wilful deception. But there are
  many others who believe it possible that the beings of the unseen world
  may manifest themselves to us in extraordinary ways; and also are unable
  otherwise to explain many facts, the evidence for which cannot be
  impeached. Both parties have obviously a common interest in wishing cases
  of supposed 'supernatural' agency to be thoroughly sifted.... The main
  impediment to investigations of this kind is the difficulty of obtaining
  a sufficient number of clear and well-attested cases. Many of the stories
  current in tradition, or scattered up and down in books, may be exactly
  true; others must be purely fictitious; others again, probably the
  greater number, consist of a mixture of truth and falsehood. But it is
  idle to examine the significance of an alleged fact of this nature, until
  the trustworthiness, and also the extent of the evidence for it, are
  ascertained. Impressed with this conviction, some members of the
  University of Cambridge are anxious, if possible, to form an extensive
  collection of authenticated cases of supposed 'supernatural' agency....
  From all those who may be inclined to aid them, they request written
  communications, with full details of persons, times, and places."</p>

  his investigations, we cannot confidently state; but in them he will find
  continual references to what Jacob Böhme terms "the eternal and astral
  magic, or the laws, powers and properties of the great Universal
  Will-Spirit of the two co-eternal worlds of darkness and light, and of
  this third or temporary principle." Freher was the principal illustrator
  of the writings of the celebrated Jacob Böhme, now exciting so much
  interest among the German literati; and, if we may credit William Law, it
  was from the principles of this remarkable man that Sir Isaac Newton
  derived his theory of fundamental powers. (See "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii.,
  p. 247.) But on this and other matters we may doubtless expect to be well
  informed by Sir David Brewster, in his new "Memoir of the Life, Writings,
  and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton." According to Law, the two-fold
  spiritual universe stands as near, and in a similar relation to this
  material mixed world, of darkness and light, evil and good, death and
  life, or rather the latter to the former, as water does to the gases of
  which it is essentially compounded.&mdash;<span

<h3>STARVATION.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 54.)</p>

  <p>Until your correspondent Q. designated the word <i>starvation</i> as
  "an Americanism," I never had the least suspicion that it was obtained
  from that source. On the contrary, I remember to have heard some thirty
  or forty years ago, that it was first employed by Harry Dundas, the first
  Viscount Melville, who might have spoken with a brogue, but whose
  despatches were in good intelligible English. I once asked his son, the
  second Viscount, whose correctness must be fresh in the recollection of
  many of your readers, if the above report was true, and he seemed to
  think that his father had coined the word, and that it immediately got
  into general circulation. My impression is, that it was already current
  during the great scarcity at the end of the last, and the commencement of
  this century; but the dictionary makers, those "who toil at the lower
  employments of life," as old Sam Johnson termed it, are not apt to be
  alert in seizing on fresh words, and "starvation" has shared in the
  general neglect.</p>

  <p>If you permit me I will, however, afford them my humble aid, by
  transcribing some omitted words which I find noted in a little Walker's
  <i>Dictionary</i>, printed in 1830, and which has been my companion in
  many pilgrimages through many distant lands. Many of them may by this
  time have found their way even into dictionaries, but I copy them as I
  find them.</p>

  <p>However "strange it may appear, it is nevertheless quite true," that
  this word, "<i>Starvation</i> <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>{152}</span>(from the verb), state of perishing from
  cold or hunger," is to be found, and thus defined, in "An Appendix to Dr.
  Johnson's English Dictionary," published along with the latter, by
  William Maver, in 2 vols. 8vo., Glasgow, 1809, now forty-five years ago.
  In his preface to this Appendix he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the compilation the editor is principally indebted to Mr. Mason,
  whose labours in supplying the deficiencies of Dr. Johnson's Dictionary
  have so much enriched the vocabulary of our language, that every
  purchaser of the quarto edition should avail himself of a copy of Mr.
  Mason's Supplement."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whether or not Mr. Maver drew the word "starvation" from Mr. Mason's
  Supplement, I cannot say; but from old date in the west of Scotland it
  has been, and is still, popularly and extensively used in the exact
  senses given to it by Mr. Maver as above. I think it much more likely to
  be of Scottish than of American origin, and that Mr. Webster may have
  picked it up from some of our natives in this country.</p>

  <p>I may add, that in early life I often spoke with Mr. Maver, who was a
  most intelligent literary man. In 1809 he followed the business of a
  bookseller in Glasgow, but from some cause was not fortunate, and
  afterwards followed that of a book auctioneer, and may be dead fully
  thirty years ago. His edition of, and Appendix to, Johnson were justly
  esteemed; the latter "containing several thousand words omitted by Dr.
  Johnson, and such as have been introduced by good writers since his
  time," with "the pronunciation according to the present practice of the
  best orators and orthoepists" of the whole language.</p>

  <p class="author">G. N.</p>

  <p>This word was first introduced into the English language by Mr.
  Dundas, in a debate in the House of Commons on American affairs, in 1775.
  From it he obtained the nick-name of "Starvation Dundas." (Vide the
  <i>Correspondence between Horace Walpole and Mason</i>, vol. ii. pp. 177.
  310. 396., edition 1851.) The word is of irregular formation, the root
  starve being Old English, while the termination <i><span
  class="nw">-ation</span></i> is Latin.</p>

  <p class="author">E. G. R.</p>

  <p>The word may perhaps be originally American; but if the following
  anecdote be correct, it was introduced into this country long before
  Webster compiled his <i>Dictionary</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The word <i>starvation</i> was first introduced into the English
  language by Mr. Dundas, in a speech in 1775 on an American debate, and
  hence applied to him as a nickname, 'Starvation Dundas.' 'I shall not,'
  said he, 'wait for the advent of starvation from Edinburgh to settle my
  judgment.'"&mdash;<i>Letters of Horace Walpole and Mason</i>, vol. ii. p.
  396.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">J. R. M., M.A.</p>

  <p>Throughout this part of the country, "starved" always refers to cold,
  never to hunger. To express the latter the word "hungered" is always
  used: thus, many were "like to have been hungered" in the late severe
  weather and hard times. This is clearly the scriptural phrase "an
  hungred." To "starve" is to perish; and it is a common expression in the
  south, "I am quite perished with cold;" which answers to our northern
  one, "I am quite starved."</p>

  <p>I cannot ascertain the period of the adoption of the unhappily common
  word "starvation" in our language, but it is much older than your
  correspondent Q. supposes. It occurs in the <i>Rolliad</i>:</p>

<h3>OSMOTHERLEY IN YORKSHIRE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 617.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">R. W. Carter</span> gives an account of folk lore in
  reference to Osmotherley, and expresses a desire to know if his statement
  is authentic. I have endeavoured to make myself acquainted with Yorkshire
  folk lore, and beg to inform <span class="sc">Mr. Carter</span> that his
  statement approaches as near the truth as possible. In my early days I
  frequently had recited to me, by a respectable farmer who had been
  educated on the borders of Roseberry (and who obtained it from the
  rustics of the neighbourhood), a poetical legend, in which all the
  particulars of this curious tradition are embodied. It is as follows:</p>

<table class="pl05" style="margin-left:4em;">
<tr><td style="padding-left: 0.2em;"> "In Cleveland's vale a village stands,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Though no great prospect it commands;</td></tr>
<tr><td> As pleasantly for situation</td></tr>
<tr><td> As any village in the nation.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Great Ayton it is call'd by name;</td></tr>
<tr><td> But though I am no man of fame,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Yet do not take me for a fool,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Because I live near to this town;</td></tr>
<tr><td> But let us take a walk and see</td></tr>
<tr><td> This noted hill call'd Roseberry,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Compos'd of many a cragged stone,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Resembling all one solid cone,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Which, monumental-like, have stood</td></tr>
<tr><td> Ever since the days of Noah's flood.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Here cockles ... petrified,</td></tr>
<tr><td> As by the curious have been tried,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Have oft been found upon its top,</td></tr>
<tr><td> 'Tis thought the Deluge had cast up.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 'Tis mountains high (you may see that),</td></tr>
<tr><td> Though not compar'd with Ararat.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding:0em">
<table><tr><td>Yet oft at sea it doth appear,</td><td rowspan="3" class="vmi"><img src="images/rbrace.png" class="middle" style="height:7ex;width:0.75em;" alt="brace" title="brace" /></td></tr>
<tr><td>To ships that northern climates steer,</td></tr>
<tr><td>A land-mark, when the weather's clear.</td></tr></table>
</td></tr>
<tr><td> If many ships at sea there be,</td></tr>
<tr><td> A charming prospect then you'll see;</td></tr>
<tr><td> Don't think I fib, when this you're reading,</td></tr>
<tr><td> They look like sheep on mountains feeding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>
Then turn your eyes on the other hand,</td></tr>
<tr><td> As pleasing views you may command.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding:0em">
<table><tr><td>For thirty miles or more, they say,</td><td rowspan="3" class="vmi"><img src="images/rbrace.png" class="middle" style="height:7ex;width:0.75em;" alt="brace" title="brace" /></td></tr>
<tr><td>The country round you may survey,</td></tr>
<tr><td>When the air's serene and clear the day.</td></tr></table>
</td></tr>
<tr><td> There is a cave near to its top,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Vulgarly call'd the Cobbler's Shop,</td></tr>
<tr><td> By Nature form'd out of the rock,</td></tr>
<tr><td> And able to withstand a shock.</td></tr>
<tr><td> On the north side there is a well,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Relating which this Fame doth tell:</td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding:0em">
<table><tr><td>Prince Oswy had his nativity</td><td rowspan="5" class="vmi"><img src="images/rbrace.png" class="middle" style="height:14ex;width:0.75em;" alt="brace" title="brace" /></td></tr>
<tr><td>Computed by astrology,</td></tr>
<tr><td>That he unnatural death should die.</td></tr>
<tr><td>His mother to this well did fly</td></tr>
<tr><td>To save him from sad destiny;</td></tr></table>
</td></tr>
<tr><td> But one day sleeping in the shade,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Supposing all secure was made,</td></tr>
<tr><td> Lo! sorrow soon gave place to joy;</td></tr>
<tr><td> This well sprung up and drown'd the boy."</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>It is confidently stated, in the neighbourhood of Osmotherley and
  Roseberry, that Prince Oswy and his mother were both interred at
  Osmotherley, from whence comes the name of the place,
  Os-by-his-mother-lay, or Osmotherley.</p>

<h3>"WURM," IN MODERN GERMAN&mdash;PASSAGE IN SCHILLER'S "WALLENSTEIN."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 464. 624.; Vol. ix., p. 63.)</p>

  <p>I believe <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span> is perfectly right in
  his conjecture, so far as Schiller is concerned. <i>Wurm</i>, without any
  prefix, <i>had</i> the sense of serpent in German. Adelung says it was
  used for all animals without feet who move on their bellies, serpents
  among the rest. Schiller does not seem to have had Shakspeare in his
  thoughts, but the proverb quoted by Adelung:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Auch das friedlichste Würmchen <i>beiszt</i>, wenn man es treten
  will."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In this proverb there is evidently an allusion to the serpent, as if
  of the same nature with the worm; which, as <i>we</i> know, neither
  <i>stings</i> nor <i>bites</i> the foot which treads on it. Shakspeare
  therefore says "will turn," making a distinction, which Schiller does
  <i>not</i> make. In the translation Coleridge evidently had Shakspeare in
  his recollection; but he has not lost Schiller's idea, which gives the
  worm a serpent's <i>sting</i>. <i>Vermo</i> is applied both by Dante and
  Ariosto to the Devil, as the "great serpent:"</p>

  <p>With deference to C. B. d'O., I consider that <i>Wurm</i> is used, in
  poetry at least, to designate any individual of the tribe of
  <i>reptiles</i>. In the <i>Kampf mit dem Drachen</i>, the rebuke of the
  "Master" is thus conveyed:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Du bist ein Gott dem Volke worden,</p>

<h3>WAS SHAKSPEARE DESCENDED FROM A LANDED PROPRIETOR?</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 75.)</p>

  <p>I am inclined to think that <span class="sc">Mr. Halliwell</span> has
  been misled by his old law-books, for upon looking at the principal
  authorities upon this point, I cannot find any such interpretation of the
  term <i>inheritance</i> as that quoted by him from Cowell. The words "the
  inheritance," in the passage "heretofore the inheritance of William
  Shakspeare, Gent., deceased," would most certainly appear to imply that
  Shakspeare inherited the lands as heir-at-law to some one. But, however,
  it must not be concluded upon this alone that the poet's father was a
  landed proprietor, as the inheritance could proceed from any other
  ancestor to whom Shakspeare was by law heir.</p>

  <p>Blackstone, in his <i>Commentaries</i>, has the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Descent, or hereditary succession, is the title whereby a man on the
  death of his ancestor acquires his estate by right of representation, as
  his heir-at-law. An heir, therefore, is he upon whom the law casts the
  estate immediately on the death of the ancestor: and an estate, so
  descending to the heirs, is in Law called <i>the
  inheritance</i>."&mdash;Vol. ii. p. 201.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>{155}</span></p>

  <p>Again:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Purchase, <i>perquisitio</i>, taken in its largest and most extensive
  sense, is thus defined by Littleton; the possession of lands and
  tenements which a man hath by his own act or agreement, and not by
  descent from any of his ancestors or kindred. In this sense it is
  contra-distinguished from acquisition by right of blood, and includes
  every other method of coming to an estate, <i>but merely that by
  inheritance</i>: wherein the title is vested in a person, not by his own
  act or agreement, but by the single operation of law."&mdash;Vol. ii. p.
  241.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus it is clear the possession of an estate by inheritance is created
  only by a person being heir to it; and the mere purchase of it, though it
  vests the fee simple in him, can but make him the <i>assign</i> and not
  the <i>heir</i>. The nomination (as it would be in the case of a
  purchase) of an heir to succeed to the inheritance, has no place in the
  English law; the maxim being "Solus Deus hæredem facere potest, non
  homo;" and all other persons, whom a tenant in fee simple may please to
  appoint as his successors, are not his heirs but his assigns. (See
  <i>Williams on the Law of Real Property</i>.)</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Russell Gole.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Halliwell</span> is perfectly right in his
  opinion as to the expression "heretofore the <i>inheritance</i> of
  William Shakspeare." All that that expression in a deed means is, that
  Shakspeare was the absolute owner of the estate, so that he could sell,
  grant, or devise it; and in case he did not do so, it would descend to
  his heir-at-law. The term has no reference to the mode by which the
  estate came to Shakspeare, but only to the nature of the estate he had in
  the property. And as a man may become possessed of such an estate in land
  by gift, purchase, devise, adverse possession, &amp;c., as well as by
  descent from some one else, the mere fact that a man has such an estate
  affords no inference whatever as to the mode in which he became possessed
  of it. The authorities on the subject are Littleton, section ix., and Co.
  Litt., p. 16. (a), &amp;c. A case is there mentioned so long ago as the 6
  Edw. III., where, in an action of waste, the plaintiff alleged that the
  defendant held "de hæreditate suâ," and it was ruled that, albeit the
  plaintiff had purchased the reversion, the allegation was sufficient.</p>

  <p>In very ancient deeds the word is very commonly used where it
  <i>cannot</i> mean an estate that has descended to an heir, but
  <i>must</i> mean an estate that may descend to an heir. Thus, in a grant
  I have (without date, and therefore probably before <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1300), Robert de Boltone grants land to John, the
  son of Geoffrey, to be held by the said John and his heirs "in feodo et
  hæreditate in perpetuum." This plainly shows that <i>hæreditas</i> is
  here used as equivalent to "fee simple." I have also sundry other equally
  ancient deeds, by which lands were granted to be held "jure hæreditaris,"
  or "liberè, quietè, <i>hæreditariè</i>, et in pace." Now these
  expressions plainly indicate, not that the land has descended to the
  party as heir, but that it is granted to him so absolutely that it may
  descend to his heir; in other words, that an <i>estate of
  inheritance</i>, and not merely for life or for years, is granted by the
  deed.</p>

  <p class="author">S. G. C.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Halliwell's</span> exposition of the term
  "inheritance," quoted from the Shakspeare deed, is substantially correct,
  and there can be no question but that the sentence "heretofore the
  inheritance of William Shakspeare, Gent., deceased," was introduced in
  such deed, simply to show that Shakspeare was formerly the <i>absolute
  owner in fee simple</i> of the premises comprised therein, and not to
  indicate that he had acquired them by descent, either as heir of his
  father or mother, although he might have done so. As <span class="sc">Mr.
  Halliwell</span> appears to attach some importance to the word
  "purchase," as used by Cowell in his definition of the term
  "inheritance," the following explanation of the word "purchase" may not
  prove unacceptable to him.</p>

  <p>Purchase&mdash;"Acquisitum, perquisitum, purchasium"&mdash;signifies
  the <i>buying</i> or acquisition of lands and tenements, with
  <i>money</i>, or by taking them by deed or agreement, and <i>not by
  descent or hereditary right</i>. (Lit. xii.; Reg. Orig., 143.) In Law a
  man is said to come in by purchase when he acquires lands by legal
  conveyance, and he hath a lawful estate; and a purchase is always
  intended by title, either from some consideration or by gift (for a gift
  is in Law a purchase), whereas descent from an ancestor cometh of course
  by act of law; also all contracts are comprehended under this word
  purchase. (Coke on <i>Littleton</i>, xviii., "Doctor and Student," c.
  24.) Purchase, in opposition to descent, is taken largely: if an estate
  comes to a man from his ancestors without writing, that is a descent; but
  where a person takes an estate from an ancestor or others, by deed, will,
  or gift, and <i>not as heir-at-law</i>, that is a purchase. This
  explanation might be extended, but it is not necessary to carry it
  farther for the purpose of <span class="sc">Mr. Halliwell's</span>
  inquiry.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Charlecote.</span></p>

  <p>The word "inheritance" was used for hereditament, the former being
  merely the French form, the latter the Latin. Littleton (§ 9.) says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Et est ascavoir que cest parol (enheritance) nest pas tant solement
  entendus lou home ad terres ou tenementes per discent de heritage, mes
  auxi chescun fee simple ou taile que home ad per son purchase puit estre
  dit enheritance, pur ceo que ses heires luy purront enheriter. Car en
  briefe de droit que home portera de terre, que fuit de son purchase
  demesne, le briefe dira: Quam clamat esse jus et hereditamentum suum. Et
  issint serra dit en divers auters briefes, que home ou feme portera de
  son purchase demesne, come il appiert per le Register."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The word is still in use, and signifies what is capable of being
  inherited.</p>

<h3>LORD FAIRFAX.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 10.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent W. H. M. has called my attention to his Note, and
  requested me to answer the third of his Queries.</p>

  <p>The present rightful heir to the barony of Fairfax, should he wish to
  claim it, is a citizen of the United States, and a resident in the State
  of Virginia. He is addressed, as any other American gentleman would be,
  Mr., when personally spoken to, and as an Esquire in correspondence.</p>

  <p>A friend of mine, Captain W., has thus kindly answered the other
  Queries of W. H. M.:</p>

  <p>1. Sir Thomas Fairfax of Denton in Yorkshire was employed in several
  diplomatic affairs by Queen Elizabeth, and particularly in negotiations
  with James VI. of Scotland. By Charles I. he was created a peer of
  Scotland, his patent having been dated at Whitehall on Oct. 18, <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1627.</p>

  <p>2. The family of Fairfax never possessed property, or land, in
  Scotland, and had no connexion with that country beyond their peerage.
  Many English gentlemen were created peers of Scotland by the Stuart
  kings, although unconnected with the nation by descent or property. I may
  cite the following instances:&mdash;The old Yorkshire House of Constable
  of Burton received a peerage in the person of Sir Henry Constable of
  Burton and Halsham; by patent, dated Nov. 14, 1620, Sir Henry was created
  Viscount Dunbar and Lord Constable. Sir Walter Aston of Tixal in
  Staffordshire, Bart., was created Baron Aston of Forfar by Charles I.,
  Nov. 28, 1627. And, lastly, Sir Thomas Osborne of Kineton, Bart., was
  created by Charles II., Feb. 2, 1673, Viscount Dumblane.</p>

  <p>3. Answered.</p>

  <p>4. William Fairfax, fourth son of Henry Fairfax of Tolston, co. York,
  second son of Henry, fourth Lord Fairfax, settled in New England in
  America, and was agent for his cousin Thomas, sixth lord, and had the
  entire management of his estates in Virginia. His third and only
  surviving son, Bryan Fairfax, was in holy orders, and resided in the
  United States. On the death of Robert, seventh Lord Fairfax, July 15,
  1793, this Bryan went to England and preferred his claim to the peerage,
  which was determined in his favour by the House of Lords. He then
  returned to America. Bryan Fairfax married a Miss Elizabeth Cary, and had
  several children. (Vide Douglas, and Burke's <i>Peerage</i>.)</p>

  <p>There are several English families who possess Scottish peerages, but
  they are derived from Scottish ancestors, as Talmash, Radclyffe, Eyre,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the writer may be permitted to inform your correspondent W. H.
  M. that the term "subject" is more commonly and correctly applied to a
  person who owes allegiance to a crowned head, and "citizen" to one who is
  born and lives under a republican form of government.</p>

  <p class="author">W. W.</p>

  <p class="address">Malta.</p>

  <p>1. Thomas, first Lord Fairfax (descended from a family asserted to
  have been seated at Towcester, co. Northampton, at the time of the Norman
  invasion and subsequently of note in Yorkshire), accompanied the Earl of
  Essex into France, temp. Eliz., and was knighted by him in the camp
  before Rouen. He was created a peer of Scotland, 4th May, 1627; but why
  of Scotland, or for what services, I know not.</p>

  <p>2. I cannot discover that the family ever possessed lands in Scotland.
  They were formerly owners of Denton Castle, co. York (which they sold to
  the family of Ibbetson, Barts.), and afterwards of Leeds Castle,
  Kent.</p>

  <p>3. Precise information on this point is looked for from some
  transatlantic correspondent.</p>

  <p>4. The claim of the Rev. Bryan, eighth Lord Fairfax, was admitted by
  the House of Lords, 6th May, 1800 (<i>H. L. Journals</i>). He was, I
  presume, born before the acknowledgment of independence.</p>

  <p>5. The title seems to be erroneously retained in the Peerages, as the
  gentleman now styled Lord Fairfax cannot, it is apprehended, be a
  natural-born subject of the British Crown, or capable of inheriting the
  dignity. It seems, therefore, that the peerage, if not extinct, awaits
  another claimant. As a direct authority, I may refer to the case of the
  Scottish earldom of Newburgh, in the succession to which the next heir
  (the Prince Gustiniani), being an alien, was passed over as a legal
  nonentity. (See <i>Riddell on Scottish Peerages</i>, p. 720.) There is
  another case not very easily reconcilable with the last, viz. that of the
  Earl of Athlone, who, though a natural-born subject of the Prince of
  Orange, was on 10th March, 1795, permitted to take his seat in the House
  of Lords in Ireland (<i>Journals H. L. I.</i>). Perhaps some
  correspondent will explain this case.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Mr. Lyte on Collodion.</i>&mdash;When I had the pleasure of meeting
  you in London, I promised that I would write to you from this place, and
  give you a detailed account of my method of making the collodion, of
  which I left a sample with you; but since then have been making a series
  of experiments, with a view, first, to simplifying my present formulæ,
  and next, to produce two collodions, one of great sensibility, the other
  of rather slower action, but producing better half-tones. I have also
  been considering the subject of <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>{157}</span>printing, and the best methods of
  producing those beautiful black tints which are so much prized; and I
  think that, although the processes formerly given all of them produce
  this effect with tolerable certainty, yet many operators, in common with
  myself, have met with the most provoking failures on this head, where
  they felt the most certain of good results.</p>

  <p>I do not pretend to make a collodion which is different in its
  ingredients from that compounded by others. The only thing is that I am
  anxious to define the best proportions for making it, and to give a
  formula which even the most unpractised operator may work by. First, to
  produce the collodion I always use the soluble paper prepared according
  to the method indicated by <span class="sc">Mr. Crookes</span>, and to
  which I adverted in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., p. 252. Take of colourless
  nitric acid of 1.50, and sulphuric acid of 1.60, equal quantities by
  measure, and mix them; then plunge into the mixture as much of the best
  Swedish filtering paper (Papier Joseph is also very good) as the liquid
  will cover; it must be placed in it a single piece at a time. Cover the
  basin, and let it remain a night, or at least some hours. Then pour off
  the liquid, and wash the paper till its washings cease to taste the least
  acid, or to redden litmus paper. Then dry it. Of this paper I take 180
  grains to one pint of ether, and having placed them together, I add
  alcohol drop by drop, till the ether begins to dissolve the paper, which
  will be denoted by the paper becoming quite transparent. I have rather
  increased the quantity of paper to be added, as the after treatment
  rather thins the collodion. This, when shaken up and completely
  dissolved, forms the collodion. To sensitize I use two preparations, one
  prepared with potassium, the other with ammonium compounds; and, contrary
  to what many operators find the case, I find that the potassium gives the
  most rapid results. To prepare the potassium sensitizer, I take two
  bottles of, we will suppose, 6 oz. each; into one of these I put about
  half an ounce of iodide of potassium in fine powder, and into the other
  an equal quantity of bromide of potassium, also pounded; we will call
  these No. 1. and No. 2. I fill the bottle No. 1. with absolute alcohol,
  taking great care that there is no oxide of amyle in it, as that
  seriously interferes with the action of the collodion. After leaving the
  alcohol in No. 1. for two hours, or thereabouts, constantly shaking it,
  let it settle, and then quite clear decant it off into No. 2., where
  leave it again, with constant shaking, for two hours, and when settled
  decant the clear liquid into a third bottle for use. The oxide of amyle
  may be detected by taking a portion of the alcohol between the palms of
  the hands, and rubbing them together, till the alcohol evaporates, after
  which, should oxide of amyle be present, it will easily be detected by
  its smell, which is not unlike that exhaled by a diseased potato. Of the
  liquid prepared, take one part to add to every three parts of collodion.
  The next, or ammonium sensitizer, is made as follows. Take</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> Absolute alcohol</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 10</td>
<td> oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Iodide of ammon.</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 100</td>
<td> grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Bromide of ammon.<span class="gap"></span></td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 25</td>
<td> grs.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Mix, and when dissolved, take one part to three of collodion, as
  before. I feel certain that on a strict adherence to the correct
  proportion depends all the success of photography; and as we find in the
  kindred process of the daguerrotype, that if we add too much or too
  little of the bromine sensitizer, we make the plate less sensitive, so in
  this process. When making the first of these sensitizers, I always in
  each case let the solution attain a temperature of about 60º before
  decanting, so as to attain a perfectly equable compound on all
  occasions.</p>

  <p>In the second, or ammonium sensitizer, the solution may be assisted by
  a moderate heat, and when again cooled, may advantageously be filtered to
  separate any sediment which may exist; but neither of these liquids
  should ever be exposed to great cold.</p>

  <p>I dissolve in my bath of nitrate of silver as much freshly
  precipitated bromide of silver as it will take up. Next, as to the
  printing of positives to obtain black tints, the only condition necessary
  to produce this result is having an acid nitrate bath; whether the
  positive be printed on albumen paper, or common salted paper, the result
  will always be the same. I have tried various acids in the bath, viz.
  nitric, sulphuric, tartaric, and acetic, and prefer the latter, as being
  the most manageable, and having a high equivalent. The paper I now
  constantly use is common salted paper, prepared as follows. Take</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> Chloride of barium</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 180</td>
<td> grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Chloride of ammon.</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 100</td>
<td> grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Chloride of potassium<span class="gap"></span></td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 140</td>
<td> grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Water</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 10</td>
<td> oz.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Mix, and pour into a dish and lay the paper on the liquid, wetting
  only one side; when it has lain there for about five minutes if French
  paper has been used, if English paper till it ceases to curl and falls
  flat on the liquid, let it be hung up by a bent pin to dry. These salts
  are better than those generally recommended, as they do not form such
  deliquescent salts when decomposed as the chloride of sodium does, and
  for this reason I should have even avoided the chloride of ammonium, only
  that it so much assists the tints; however, in company with the other
  salts, the nitrate of ammon. formed does not much take up the atmospheric
  moisture, and I have never found it stain an even unvarnished negative.
  To sensitize this paper take</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> Nitrate of silver</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 500</td>
<td> grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Acetic acid, glacial<span class="gap"></span></td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 2</td>
<td> drs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Water</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 5</td>
<td> oz.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Mix, and lay the paper on this solution for not less than five
  minutes, and if English paper, double that time. The hyposulphite to be
  used may be a very strong solution of twenty to twenty-five per cent.,
  and this mode of treatment will always be found to produce fine tints.
  After some time it will be found that the nitrate bath will lose its
  acidity, and a drachm of acetic acid may be again added, when the prints
  begin to take a red tone: this will again restore the blacks. Lastly, the
  bath may of itself get too weak, and then it will be best to place it on
  one side, and recover the silver by any of the usual methods, and make a
  new bath. One word about the addition of the bromide of <!-- Page 158
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span>silver to the
  double iodide, as recommended by <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>. I
  tried this, and feel most confident that it produces no difference; as
  soon as the bromide of silver comes in contact with the iodide of
  potassium, double decomposition ensues, and iodide of silver is formed.
  Indeed, farther, this very double decomposition, or a similar one, is the
  basis of a patent I have just taken for at the same time refining silver
  and manufacturing iodide of potassium; a process by which I much hope the
  enormous present price of iodide of potassium will be much lowered.</p>

  <p><i>On Sensitive Collodion.</i>&mdash;As I have lately received many
  requests from friends upon the subject of the most sensitive collodion, I
  am induced to send you a few words upon it.</p>

  <p>Since my former communication, I believe a greater certainty of
  manufacture has been attained, whereby the operator may more safely rely
  upon uniformity of success.</p>

  <p>I have not only tried every purchasable collodion, but my experiments
  have been innumerable, especially in respect to the ammoniated salts, and
  I may, I think, safely affirm that all preparations containing ammonia
  ought to be rejected. Often, certainly, great rapidity of action is
  obtained; but that collodion which acted so well on one day may, on the
  following, become comparatively useless, from the change which appears so
  frequently to take place in the ammoniacal compounds. That blackening and
  fogging, of which so much has been said, I much think is one of the
  results of ammonia; but not having, in my own manipulations, met with the
  difficulty, I have little personal experience upon the subject.</p>

  <p>The more simple a collodion is the better; and the following, from its
  little varying and active qualities, I believe to be equal to any now in
  use.</p>

  <p>A great deal has also been said upon the preparation of the simple
  collodion, and that some samples, however good <i>apparently</i>, never
  sensitize in a satisfactory manner. I have not experienced this
  difficulty myself, or any appreciable variation.</p>

  <p>The collodion made from the Swedish filtering paper, or the papier
  Joseph, is preferable, from the much greater care with which it is
  used.</p>

  <p>If slips of either of these papers be carefully and completely
  immersed for four hours in a mixture of an equal part (by weight) of
  strong nitric acid or nitrous acid (the aqua fortis of commerce) and
  strong sulphuric acid, then <i>perfectly</i> washed, so as to get
  entirely rid of the acids, the result will be an entirely soluble
  material. About 100 grains of dry paper to a pint (twenty ounces) of
  ether will form a collodion of the desired consistence for photographic
  purposes. If too thick, it may be reduced by pure ether or alcohol.
  However carefully this soluble paper or the gun cotton is prepared, it is
  liable to decompose even when kept with care. I would therefore advise it
  to be mixed with the ether soon after preparation, as the simple
  collodion keeps exceedingly well. Excellent simple collodion is to be
  procured now at the reasonable price of eight shillings the pint, which
  will to many be more satisfactory than trusting to their own
  operations.</p>

  <p><i>To make the sensitizing Fluid.</i>&mdash;Put into a clean stoppered
  bottle, holding more than the quantity required so as to allow of free
  shaking, six drachms of iodide of potassium and one drachm of bromide of
  potassium; wet them with one drachm of distilled water first, then pour
  into the bottle ten ounces of spirits of wine (not alcohol); shake
  frequently until dissolved. After some hours, if the solution has not
  taken place, add a few more drops of water, the salts being highly
  soluble in water, though sparingly so in rectified spirits; but care must
  be taken not to add too much, as it prevents the subsequent adhesion of
  the collodion film to the glass.</p>

  <p>A drachm and a half to two drachms, according to the degree of
  intensity desired, added to the ounce of the above collodion, which
  should have remained a few days to settle before sensitizing, I find to
  act most satisfactorily; in fine weather it is instantaneous, being,
  after a good shake, fit for immediate use. If the sensitive collodion
  soon assumes a reddish colour, it is improved by the addition of one or
  two drops of a saturated solution of cyanide of potassium; but great care
  must be used, as this salt is very active.</p>

  learned serjeant only said that "he believed" the fact was so. But he was
  undoubtedly mistaken, probably from confounding <!-- Page 159 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span>the Privy Council (at
  which the Lord Mayor <i>never</i> appeared) with a meeting of other
  persons (nobility, gentry, and others), who assemble on the same occasion
  in a different room, and to which meeting (altogether distinct from the
  Privy Council) the Lord Mayor is always summoned, as are the sheriffs,
  aldermen, and a number of other notabilities, not privy councillors. This
  matter is conclusively explained in Vol. iv., p.284.; but if more
  particular evidence be required, it will be found in the <i>London
  Gazette</i> of the 20th June, 1837, where the names of the privy
  councillors are given in one list to the number of eighty-three, and in
  another list the names of the persons attending the meeting to the number
  of above 150, amongst whom are the local mayor, sheriffs, under-sheriffs,
  aldermen, common sergeants, city solicitor, &amp;c. As "N &amp; Q." has
  reproduced the mistake, it is proper that it should also reproduce the
  explanation.</p>

  <p><i>New Zealander and Westminster Bridge</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  74.).&mdash;Before I saw the thought in Walpole's letter to Sir H. Mann,
  quoted in "N. &amp; Q.," I ventured to suppose that Mrs. Barbauld's noble
  poem, <i>Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</i>, might have suggested Mr.
  Macaulay's well-known passage. The following extracts extracts describe
  the wanderings of those who&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg3">"With duteous zeal, their pilgrimage shall take,</p>
      <p>From the blue mountains on Ontario's lake,</p>
      <p>With fond adoring steps to press the sod,</p>
      <p>By statesmen, sages, poets, heroes, trod."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Pensive and thoughtful shall the wanderers greet</p>
      <p>Each splendid square, and still untrodden street;</p>
      <p>Or of some crumbling turret, mined by time,</p>
      <p>The broken stairs with perilous step shall climb,</p>
      <p>Thence stretch their view the wide horizon round,</p>
      <p>By scatter'd hamlets trace its ancient bound,</p>
      <p>And choked no more with fleets, fair Thames survey,</p>

  <p>The beautiful conception of the New Zealander at some future period
  visiting England, and giving a sketch of the ruins of London, noticed in
  "N. &amp; Q." as having been suggested to Macaulay by a passage in one of
  Walpole's letters to Sir H. Mann, will be found more broadly expressed in
  Kirke White's Poem on Time. Talking of the triumphs of Oblivion, he
  says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Meanwhile the Arts, in second infancy,</p>
      <p>Rise in some distant clime; and then, perchance,</p>
      <p>Some bold adventurer, fill'd with golden dreams,</p>
      <p>Steering his bark through trackless solitudes,</p>
      <p>Where, to his wandering thoughts, no daring prow</p>
      <p>Had ever plough'd before,&mdash;espies the cliffs</p>
      <p>Of fallen Albion. To the land unknown</p>
      <p>He journeys joyful; and perhaps descries</p>
      <p>Some vestige of her ancient stateliness:</p>
      <p>Then he with vain conjecture fills his mind</p>
      <p>Of the unheard-of race, which had arrived</p>
      <p>At science in that solitary nook,</p>
      <p>Far from the civil world; and sagely sighs,</p>
      <p>And moralises on the state of man."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This hardly reads like a borrowed idea; and I should lean to a belief
  that it was not. Kirke White's <i>Poems and Letters</i> are but too
  little read.</p>

  <p><i>Cui Bono</i> (Vol. ix., p. 76.).&mdash;Reference to a dictionary
  would have settled this. According to Freund, "Cui bono fuit=Zu welchem
  Zwecke, or Wozu war es gut?" That is, To what purpose? or, For
  <i>whose</i> good?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Carnatic.</span></p>

  <p>The syntax of this common phrase, with the ellipses supplied, is, "Cui
  homini fuerit bono negotio?" To what person will it be an advantage?
  Literally, or more freely rendered, Who will be the gainer by it? It was
  (see <i>Ascon. in Cicer. pro Milone</i>, c. xii.) the usual query of
  Lucius Cassius, the Roman judge, implying that the person benefiting by
  any crime was implicated therein. (Consult Facciolati's <i>Dict. in
  voce</i> <span class="sc">Bonum</span>.)</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Hk.</span></p>

  <p>The correct rendering of this phrase is undoubtedly that given by
  <span class="sc">F. Newman</span>, "For the benefit of whom?" but it is
  generally used in such a manner as to make it indifferent whether that,
  or the corrupted signification "For what good?" was intended by the
  writer making use of it. The latter is, however, the idea generally
  conveyed to the mind, and in this sense it is used by the best writers.
  Thus, <i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The question '<i>cui bono</i>,' to what practical end and advantage
  do your researches tend? is one," &amp;c.&mdash;Herschel's <i>Discourse

  <p><i>Barrels Regiment</i> (Vol. viii., p. 620.; Vol. ix., p.

  though it does not quite answer my purpose, which was to learn the
  circumstances which occasioned a print in my possession, entitled "The
  Old Scourge returned to Barrels." It represents a regiment, the body of
  each <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>soldier being in the form of a barrel,
  drawn up within view of Edinburgh Castle. A soldier is tied up to the
  halberts in order to be flogged; the drummer intercedes: "Col., he
  behaved well at Culloden." An officer also intercedes: "Pray Col. forgive
  him, he's a good man." The Col.'s reply is, "Flog the villain, ye
  rascal." Under the print&mdash;"And ten times a day whip the Barrels." I
  want to know who this flogging Col. was; and anything more about him
  which gained for him the unenviable title of Old Scourge.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Matthew Hale</i> (Vol. ix., p. 77.).&mdash;From Sir Matthew
  Hale, who was born at Alderley, descends the present family of Hale of
  Alderley, co. Gloucestershire. The eldest son of the head of the family
  represents West Gloucestershire in parliament. The Estcourts of Estcourt,
  co. Gloucestershire, are, I believe, also connexions of the family of
  Hale.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Mackenzie Walcott, M.A.</span></p>

  <p>The descendants of Sir Matthew Hale still live at Alderley, near
  Wotton Underedge, in Gloucestershire. I believe a Mr. Blagdon married the
  heiress of Hale, and took her name. The late Robert Blagdon Hale, Esq.,
  married Lady Theodosia Bourke, daughter of the late Lord Mayo, and had
  two sons. Robert, the eldest, and present possessor of Alderley, married
  a Miss Holford. Matthew, a clergyman, also married; who appears by the
  Clergy List to be Archdeacon of Adelaide, South Australia. Mr. John Hale,
  of Gloucester, is their uncle, and has a family.</p>

  <p>The Hales of Alderley in Gloucestershire claim descent from Sir
  Matthew Hale, born and buried there. (See Atkins, p. 107.; Rudder, p.
  218., and Bigland, p. 30.) When Mr. Hale of Alderley was High Sheriff of
  Gloucestershire in 1826, the judge then on circuit made a complimentary
  allusion to it in court. The descent is in the female line, and the name
  was assumed in 1784.</p>

  <p>I can also refer him to Sir William Dugdale's <i>Baronage of

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Design'd to retire unto his castle at Kenilworth. But being on his
  journey thitherwards, at Cornbury Park in Com. Oxon., he died upon the
  fourth of September, an. 1588, of a feaver, as 'twas said, and was buried
  at Warwick, where he hath a noble monument."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But neither in the above writers, nor in any more recent account of
  his life, have I seen his death ascribed to poison. The ground on which
  Stanfield Hall has been regarded as the birthplace of Amy Robsart is,
  that her parents Sir John and Lady Elizabeth Robsart resided at Stanfield
  Hall in 1546, according to Blomefield in his <i>History of Norfolk</i>,
  though where he resided at his daughter's birth does not appear.</p>

  <p><i>General Fraser</i> (Vol. viii., p. 586.).&mdash;Simon Fraser,
  Lieut.-Colonel, 24th Regiment, and Brigadier-General was second in
  command under Burgoyne when he advanced from Canada to New York with 7000
  men in 1777. He fell at Stillwater, a short time before the surrender of
  Burgoyne at Saratoga. He was struck by a shot from a tree, as he was
  advancing at the head of his troops; and died of his wound October 7,
  1777. He was buried, as he had desired, in the redoubt on the field, in
  the front of the American army commanded by General Gates. During his
  interment, the incessant cannonade of the enemy covered with dust the
  chaplain and the officers who assisted in performing the last duties to
  his remains, they being within view of the greatest part of both armies.
  An impression long prevailed among the officers of Burgoyne's army, that
  if Fraser had lived, the issue of the campaign, and of the whole war,
  would have been very different from what it was. Burgoyne is said to have
  shed tears at his death. General Fraser's regiment had been employed
  under Wolfe in ascending the Heights of Abraham, Sept. 12, 1759; where,
  both before and after the fall of Wolfe, the Highlanders rendered very
  efficient service. His regiment was also engaged with three others under
  Murray at the battle of Quebec in 1760. Some incidental mention of
  General Fraser will be found in Cannon's <i>History of the 31st
  Regiment</i>, published by Furnivall, 30. Whitehall; but I am not aware
  of any memoirs or life of him having been published.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The true origin and meaning of <i>forlorn hope</i> has no doubt been
  fully explained in "N &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., p. 569. Richardson's
  <i>Dictionary</i> does not countenance this view, but his example proves
  it conclusively. He only gives one quotation, from North's
  <i>Plutarch</i>; and as it stands in the dictionary, it is not easy to
  comprehend the passage entirely. On comparing it, however, with the
  corresponding passage in Langhorne (Valpy's edition, vol. iii. p. 97.),
  and again with Pompei's Italian version (vol. iii. p. 49.), I have no
  doubt that, by the term <i>forlorn hope</i>, North implied merely an
  advanced party; for as he is describing a pitched battle and not a siege,
  a modern forlorn hope would be strangely out of place.</p>

  <p>Is <i>enfans perdus</i> the idiomatic French equivalent, or is it only
  dictionary-French? And what is the German or the Italian expression?</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The Rev. Edward Trollope, F.S.A., wisely conceiving that an
  illustrated work, comprising specimens of the arms, armour, jewellery,
  furniture, vases, &amp;c., discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum, might
  be acceptable to those numerous readers to whom the magnificent volumes,
  published by the Neapolitan government, are inaccessible, has just issued
  a quarto volume under the title of <i>Illustrations of Ancient Art,
  selected from Objects discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum</i>. The
  various materials which he has selected from the <i>Museo Borbonico</i>,
  and other works, and a large number of his own sketches, have been
  carefully classified; and we think few will turn from an examination of
  the forty-five plates of Mr. Trollope's admirable outlines, without
  admiring the good taste with which the various subjects have been
  selected, and acknowledging the light which they throw upon the social
  condition, the manners, customs, and domestic life, of the Roman
  people.</p>

  <p>As the great Duke of Marlborough confessed that he acquired his
  knowledge of his country's annals in the historical plays of Shakspeare,
  so we believe there are many who find it convenient and agreeable to
  study them in Miss Strickland's <i>Lives of the Queens of England</i>. To
  all such it will be welcome news that the first and second volumes of a
  new and cheaper edition, and which comprise the lives of all our female
  sovereigns, from Matilda of Flanders to the unfortunate Anne Boleyn, are
  now ready; and will be followed month by month by the remaining six. At
  the close of the work, we may take an opportunity of examining the causes
  of the great popularity which it has attained.</p>

  <p>Mr. M. A. Lower has just published a small volume of antiquarian
  gossip, under the title of <i>Contributions to Literature, Historical,
  Antiquarian, and Metrical</i>, in which he discourses pleasantly on Local
  Nomenclature, the Battle of Hastings, the Iron Works of the South-East of
  England, the South Downs, Genealogy, and many kindred subjects; and tries
  his hand, by no means unsuccessfully, at some metrical versions of old
  Sussex legends. Several of the papers have already appeared in print, but
  they serve to make up a volume which will give the lover of popular
  antiquities an evening's pleasant reading.</p>

  <p>We beg to call the attention of our readers to the opportunity which
  will be afforded them on Wednesday next of hearing Mr. Layard lecture on
  his recent <i>Discoveries at Nineveh</i>. As they will see by the
  advertisement in our present Number, Mr. Layard has undertaken to do so
  for the purpose of contributing to the schools and other parochial
  charities of the poor but densely populated district of St. Thomas,

WILLIAM R. ROBINSON, ESQ., <i>Deputy-Chairman</i>.</p>

<p class="ac">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>The SCALE OF PREMIUMS adopted by this Office will be found of a very
  moderate character, but at the same time quite adequate to the risk
  incurred.</p>

  <p>FOUR-FIFTHS, or 80 per cent. of the Profits, are assigned to Policies
  <i>every fifth year</i>, and may be applied to increase the sum insured,
  to an immediate payment in cash, or to the reduction and ultimate
  extinction of future Premiums.</p>

  <p>ONE-THIRD of the Premium on Insurances of 500<i>l.</i> and upwards,
  for the whole term of life, may remain as a debt upon the Policy, to be
  paid off at convenience; or the Directors will lend sums of 50<i>l.</i>
  and upwards, on the security of Policies effected with this Company for
  the whole term of life, when they have acquired an adequate value.</p>

  <p>SECURITY.&mdash;Those who effect Insurances with this Company are
  protected by its Subscribed Capital of 750,000<i>l.</i>, of which nearly
  140,000<i>l.</i> is invested, from the risk incurred by Members of Mutual
  Societies.</p>

  <p>The satisfactory financial condition of the Company, exclusive of the
  Subscribed and Invested Capital, will be seen by the following
  Statement:</p>

<table class="mc" summary="Assets." title="Assets.">
<tr><td>On the 31st October, 1853, the sums Assured, including Bonus added, amounted to<span class="gap"></span></td><td class="ar">£2,500,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Premium Fund to more than </td><td class="ar"> 800,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>And the Annual Income from the same source, to </td><td class="ar"> 109,000</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Insurances, without participation in Profits, may be effected at
  reduced rates.</p>
